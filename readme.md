# Treasure Vault Mini Game

## Description

The **Treasure Vault Mini Game** is a fun and interactive mini-game where the player must unlock a vault by entering a secret combination of rotations. The game begins with the vault door closed, and a random secret combination is logged in the browser console. The player has to follow the instructions to rotate the handle in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, based on the generated combination.

If the player enters the combination correctly, the vault opens, revealing treasure inside. If the player makes an error, the vault handle spins wildly, and the game resets with a new secret combination.

## Game Mechanics

- **Secret Combination**: 
  - At the start of the game, a random combination of 3 pairs of numbers and directions is generated and logged in the console.
  - Each pair consists of a number between 1 and 9 and a direction: **clockwise** or **counterclockwise**.
  - Example: `2 clockwise, 7 counterclockwise, 5 clockwise`.
  - Each number represents a displacement of the handle by 60째. For example, `1` means 60째, `6` means a full rotation (360째).

- **Player Interaction**:
  - The player can rotate the vault handle by clicking on the left or right side of the screen.
  - Clicking on the **right** rotates the handle **clockwise**.
  - Clicking on the **left** rotates the handle **counterclockwise**.
  - Each interaction causes the handle to rotate by 60째 with an animation.

- **Winning the Game**:
  - If the player enters the correct combination in the right order, the vault door opens and reveals treasure with a glittering shine effect.
  
- **Losing the Game**:
  - If the player enters an incorrect combination, the vault handle spins crazily in multiple rotations, and the game resets with a new combination.
